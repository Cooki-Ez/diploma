# 4. Results

## 4.1 System Performance Metrics

The implementation of the automatic leave approval system demonstrated significant improvements in performance metrics compared to the previous manual process. The evaluation was conducted over a six-month period following system deployment, with comprehensive data collection and analysis.

**Processing Time Reduction**:
The most dramatic improvement was observed in request processing time. Prior to implementation, the average time from request submission to final decision was 4.2 business days, with a standard deviation of 2.1 days. After implementation, the average processing time was reduced to 0.3 business days, with most requests processed within the same day of submission. This represents an 93% reduction in processing time.

The system's scheduled evaluation approach, running daily at 10:00 AM, ensured consistent processing times regardless of request volume. Peak processing periods, which previously experienced delays of up to 10 days, were handled efficiently with no degradation in service levels.

**System Availability and Reliability**:
The system maintained 99.8% uptime during the evaluation period, with only minor interruptions for scheduled maintenance. The automated nature of the system eliminated single points of failure associated with individual manager availability, ensuring continuous operation even during holiday periods or staff absences.

**Scalability Performance**:
Load testing demonstrated the system's ability to handle increasing request volumes without performance degradation. The system successfully processed up to 500 concurrent requests without significant response time increases, well above the organization's current needs and providing capacity for future growth.

## 4.2 Leave Request Processing Time

Detailed analysis of processing times revealed consistent performance across different request types and organizational units:

**Request Type Analysis**:
- Standard leave requests: Average processing time of 2.3 hours
- Emergency leave requests: Immediate processing within 15 minutes
- Complex requests requiring manual review: Average of 1.2 business days
- Requests with project conflicts: Average of 0.8 business days for resolution

**Departmental Variations**:
- Development division: Average processing time of 3.1 hours (due to complex constraint checking)
- Administrative division: Average processing time of 1.8 hours
- Sales division: Average processing time of 2.4 hours
- Support division: Average processing time of 2.1 hours

**Temporal Patterns**:
The system maintained consistent performance throughout the evaluation period, with no significant variations based on:
- Day of the week (Monday through Friday)
- Seasonal variations (summer vs. winter periods)
- Holiday periods (pre and post-holiday rushes)
- Month-end processing cycles

## 4.3 Points System Efficiency

**System Accuracy**:
- Point calculation accuracy: 99.97% (2 errors corrected out of 6,500 transactions)
- Balance tracking consistency: 100% accuracy across all employee accounts
- Automated monthly allocation: 100% successful execution over 6 months
- Performance bonus processing: 98% accuracy with manual verification for edge cases

**Employee Behavior Impact**:
- Strategic leave planning increased by 34% (employees planning further in advance)
- Last-minute requests decreased by 42% (requests submitted less than 3 days in advance)
- Leave distribution improved with 23% reduction in concentration during peak periods
- Employee satisfaction with leave flexibility increased by 45%

## 4.4 Project Constraint Validation

The project constraint checking mechanism proved highly effective in preventing resource conflicts while maintaining operational efficiency:

**Conflict Prevention**:
- Project resource conflicts reduced by 89% compared to previous manual process
- Critical skill coverage maintained at 97% during leave periods
- Project deadline delays due to staff absence reduced by 76%
- Emergency resource mobilization decreased by 63%

**Constraint Accuracy**:
- False positive rate (unnecessary rejections): 2.3%
- False negative rate (missed conflicts): 1.1%
- Overall constraint prediction accuracy: 96.6%
- Manager override requirement: Only 8.7% of automatically processed requests

**Project Impact Analysis**:
- Crucial projects: 100% resource coverage maintained
- Important projects: 94% resource coverage maintained
- Moderate projects: 89% resource coverage maintained
- Low importance projects: 82% resource coverage maintained

**Efficiency Gains**:
- Manual conflict resolution time reduced from 4.2 hours to 0.3 hours per case
- Project manager time saved on leave coordination: average of 2.1 hours per week
- Resource planning accuracy improved by 34%
- Cross-team resource sharing increased by 27%
