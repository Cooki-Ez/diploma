# Abstract

This thesis presents the design and implementation of an automated leave request approval system that addresses the inefficiencies of traditional manual approval processes in organizational settings. The research focuses on developing a points-based evaluation mechanism combined with intelligent project constraint checking to automate the decision-making process for leave requests.

The traditional approach to leave management often involves manual review by managers, resulting in delays, inconsistencies, and increased administrative overhead. This research proposes a novel solution that leverages a points-based system where employees accumulate points monthly (equivalent to leave days) and can earn additional points for exceptional performance. The system automatically evaluates leave requests based on available points and project constraints, reducing the need for manual intervention while ensuring organizational requirements are met.

The implemented system utilizes Spring Boot framework with PostgreSQL database to create a robust, scalable solution. The core innovation lies in the automatic evaluation algorithm that considers multiple factors: employee's available points, project importance levels, upcoming deadlines, and team availability during the requested leave period. The system employs scheduled evaluation processes that run daily to process pending requests, making decisions based on predefined rules and business logic.

Key contributions of this research include: (1) a comprehensive points-based framework for leave management, (2) an intelligent algorithm for project constraint evaluation, (3) implementation of role-based access control for system security, and (4) empirical validation of the system's effectiveness through performance metrics and user satisfaction surveys.

The results demonstrate that the automated system significantly reduces processing time for leave requests while maintaining fairness and consistency in decision-making. The system successfully handles various scenarios including standard leave requests, emergency situations, and project-critical periods requiring manual review. This research provides a practical solution for organizations seeking to streamline their leave management processes while maintaining operational efficiency and employee satisfaction.
